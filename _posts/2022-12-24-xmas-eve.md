<div style="font-size: 30px"><b>Dear reader,</b></div>

I don't really feel like writing much today; I've had a bit of a rough evening. I hope yours was better!

## Flipper Zero
I've wanted to buy a [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) for the past few months. I'd want to mess around with it to learn more about hardware, signals, and do some innocuous pentesting, but I've heard rumors that I'll get tracked by the FBI if I do.

If you're the FBI, hello. I'm an upstanding citizen and pay my taxes.

I heard that TikTok kids are using Flipper to mess around with doors and projectors at school. I think it's cool that kids are getting into hacking technology â€” I wish I had exposure to similar things when I was their age.

I do feel bad for their teachers, though. There's little they can do to stop the assault of signal duplication, short of taking the Flipper away entirely. Between this nonsense and the rise of ChatGPT, I am very glad I'm not a teacher right now.

I will never be able to express enough how underappreciated teachers are. I hope my past teachers are doing well. Except my high school calc teacher. I don't wish her poorly, but I don't necessarily wish her well either.
