**Dear reader,**

I always confuse Markdown syntax with sites' custom markdown syntaxes, so please forgive me if this page looks disgusting.

Since Twitter has gone rogue (thanks Elon) and I will no longer spend hours doomscrolling, I figured that I'd try out blogging. The first step is just to set up this blog.

*Edit: Uhh, Elon might actually [step down](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097?t=EMZo5sZ5DXP5tfXSXzQtLg&s=19) from Twitter? Ok.*

## About this blog

### Why did you use Jekyll?
I know that [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is all the rage these days, but I didn't really feel like paying for it, so here I am using Jekyll.

### What was it like setting up this blog?
Honestly, not that hard. The hardest part was installing a Ruby environment and making sure my global paths for Ruby and Gem were pointing to rbenv. Not going to lie, that was kind of painful, but such is development. This is why I'm a designer.

*Edit: Never mind. Asset paths are also a b@#!h with the way the custom domain was configured.*

### Next steps
I'll eventually put this blog on a subdomain instead of it hanging out as a path in the url. I'll also fix a weird asset path issue that I've hacked around.

## What are you doing today?
Great question that no one actually asked me, other than my mom. I've spent most of today cleaning, putting together my new gaming setup with my newly-built rig (backlighting, anyone?), messing around with an old Arduino kit, and now I'm setting up this blog, I guess.

## Arduino? Tell me more.
I was inspired to take out my old Arduino kit, which I've had for at least 7 years, after talking about robotics with someone. That conversation made me realize that I kind of miss hardware, and building my [new PC](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/imthereal/saved/L8ch7P) kind of whet my appetite to do more. My Arduino kit came with a motor, and I was trying to get it going as a little starter project. Sadly, the wires were really poorly soldered onto the motor, so they fell off. You can see the leftover alloy on the motor in this picture — it was previously attached to a hot wire.

Tonight, I'll probably go see Trail of Lights with friends, which is literally just a trail filled with holiday lights. Very apt name. I might bring my camera to take pics — stay tuned!
