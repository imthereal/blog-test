**Dear reader,**

I always confuse Markdown syntax with sites' custom markdown syntaxes, so please forgive me if this page looks disgusting.

Since Twitter has gone rogue (thanks Elon) and I will no longer spend hours doomscrolling, I figured that I'd try out blogging. The first step is just to set up this blog.

## About this blog

### Why did you use Jekyll?
I know that [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is all the rage these days, but I didn't really feel like paying for it, so here I am using Jekyll.

### What was it like setting up this blog?
Honestly, not that hard. The hardest part was installing a Ruby environment and making sure my global paths for Ruby and Gem were pointing to rbenv. Not going to lie, that was kind of painful, but such is development. This is why I'm a designer.

### Next steps
I'll eventually put this blog on a subdomain instead of it hanging out as a path in the url.

## What are you doing today?
Great question that no one actually asked me, other than my mom. I've most of today cleaning, putting together my new gaming setup with my newly-built rig (backlighting, anyone?), messing around with an old Arduino kit, and now I'm setting up this blog, I guess.

My Arduino kit came with a motor. Sadly, the wires were really poorly soldered onto the motor, so they fell off. You can see the leftover alloy on the motor in this picture â€” it was previously attached to a hot wire.

Tonight, I'll probably go see Trail of Lights with friends, which is literally just a trail filled with holiday lights. Very apt name.
