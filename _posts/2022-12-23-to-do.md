<div style="font-size: 30px"><b>Dear reader,</b></div>

I don't have inspiration to write about any particular topic, but since I want to force myself to write consistently, I'll do a good ol' fashioned braindump.

## Owls
I learned a few things about owls yesterday.

Owls have long and chonky legs:

You can also [see owls' eyeballs through their ears](https://www.livescience.com/61673-owl-eye-seen-through-ear.html) (warning: a bit graphic for the squeamish).


## Website builders
I've been building a website for my mom's business, and I wanted to make sure it had a super simple drag-and-drop type of CMS. I decided to use Squarespace.

Somehow, building the website on Squarespace is more painful than building it from scratch. But we persist.

## Bass
I've finally started picking up my bass (guitar) again.

My gal has, unfortunately, been collecting dust in the corner of my bedroom for years. I stopped after college, when I moved into my first non-student apartment, since neighbors who share a wall can be ruthless about noise. And roommates. I could've put on headphones, sure, but it just doesn't feel the same.

I've been trying to tabulate some basslines on my own. Normally, I'd just write the tabs by hand, but I decided to get fancy and use MuseScore. I'm surprised that a free music scoring software has such a robust featureset to do bass tablature. 

## ABG night
I attended "ABG Night" at the Milpitas Dave and Buster's the other day. ABG Night boasts half-off drinks, a 10'x10' (or maybe smaller) dance floor, and many drunk Asian people.

For the uninitiated, [Vice has a great article on ABGs](https://i-d.vice.com/en/article/g5p44x/it-was-a-cultural-reset-a-short-history-of-the-abg-aesthetic). 

I love arcades and was excited to play games, but was thoroughly disappointed by the selection at this Dave and Buster's. The games they had were akin to "Crossy Road" and "Digital Pong," and I found very few classic arcade games outside of skee ball, basketball, and DDR.

On the other hand, I was thoroughly impressed by the sheer number of ABGs in attendance. It made me want to get eyelash extensions.


## Current jams
We're rewinding to high school.
